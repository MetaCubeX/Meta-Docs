# API

## Request Example

Curl example: `curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer ${secret}' http://${controller-api}/configs?force=true -d '{"path": "", "payload": ""}' -X PUT`

This request includes the header `'Authorization: Bearer ${secret}'`, where:

- `${secret}` is the API key set in the configuration file [api](../config/general.md#external-control-api)
- `${controller-api}` is the API listening address set in the configuration file [api](../config/general.md#external-control-api)
- `?force=true` is a parameter that needs to be included in certain requests
- `'{"path": "", "payload": ""}'` is the data for the resource to be updated

In most cases, the data passed is `'{"path": "", "payload": ""}'`, which can include a new configuration file path.

!!! note
    Note that if the path is not in the Clash working directory, please manually set the `SAFE_PATHS` environment variable to add it to the safe path. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated in Windows and colon-separated in other systems).

### `/debug/pprof`

Open in a browser `http://${controller-api}/debug/pprof` to view raw DEBUG information, where:

- `allocs` indicates memory allocation for each function call, including the size of memory allocated on the stack and heap, as well as the number of allocations. This report is primarily to help identify memory leaks and frequent memory requests in the code.
- The `heap` report provides detailed information about memory usage on the heap, including the size, number, and address of allocated memory blocks, sorted by size. This report is mainly to locate areas of excessive memory usage; we can check object sizes in the heap report to find areas of high memory consumption.
