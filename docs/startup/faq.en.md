## Alpha and Meta Branch Differences

The Alpha branch is the latest commit branch, while the Meta branch merges the code from the Alpha branch at regular intervals. The Meta branch is not necessarily more stable than the Alpha branch.

## Which file should I download?

In`release`, the filename of each package includes several pieces of information, including:

* Program name (`mihomo`)
* Operating system (e.g., `android`, `darwin`, `freebsd`, `linux`, `windows`, etc.)
* Architecture (e.g., `386`, `amd64`, `arm32v7`, `arm64`, etc.)
* Compilation method:
>
> * `v1/2/3`: only for AMD64 platforms, used to mark [CPU instruction set level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels)
> * ~~`default(not specified in file name)`: Default version compiled with GOAMD64=v3 tag.~~
> * ~~`compatible`: Compiled with GOAMD64=v1 tag for compatibility with specific OS or architecture.~~
> * `go120`: Compiled with Golang1.20 for compatibility with specific OS or architecture.
> * `abi1/2`: ABI version for `loongarch64`, specific details can be found at <http://www.loongnix.cn/zh/toolchain/Golang/downloads-Go1.21/index.html>
>
* Compile branch (e.g., `alpha`)
* Git hash value of the commit (e.g., `f90066f`)

You can choose the executable file you need based on these pieces of information.

Check details between different architectural levels [here](https://go.dev/wiki/MinimumRequirements#amd64).

Check details of system compatibility information about Golang version 1.20 [here](https://go.dev/doc/go1.20#ports).

For macOS users: According to the [Go wiki](https://go.dev/doc/go1.25#darwin), Go 1.25 no longer supports macOS 11. macOS 11 users are advised to download the binary with the `go124` tag, macOS 10.15 users are advised to download the binary with the `go122` tag, and macOS 10.13 users are advised to download the binary with the `go120` tag.

For Windows users: Currently, all official builds support Windows 7 and higher. (Unofficial builds are not guaranteed to support this; we maintain [our own forked version of Golang](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/go) for compiling.)

For Linux users: According to the [go wiki](https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#linux), Go 1.24 only supports kernels 3.2 and higher. For kernels 2.6.32 to 3.1, please download the binary tagged `go123`.
