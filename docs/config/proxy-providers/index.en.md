## Name

This is required, such as `provider1`, and must be unique. It is advisable not to duplicate names with [policy groups](../proxy-groups/index.md#name).

## Type

This is required, the `provider` type, with options of `http/file`.

## URL

If the type is `http`, this must be configured.

## Path

Optional, the file path, must be unique. If not provided, the MD5 of the URL will be used as the filename.

For security reasons, this path is restricted to only allow locations within `HomeDir` (configured with the -d startup parameter). If you wish to store it in any location, set the environment variable `SKIP_SAFE_PATH_CHECK=1`.

## Interval

The update time for the `provider`, measured in seconds.

## Proxy

Download/update through the specified proxy.

## Header

Custom HTTP request headers.

## Health Check

Health check (latency testing).

### health-check.enable

Whether to enable, optional `true/false`.

### health-check.url

Health check address, it is recommended to use one of the following addresses:

=== "Cloudflare"
    ```yaml
    https://cp.cloudflare.com
    ```

=== "Google"
    ```yaml
    https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204
    ```

### health-check.interval

Health check interval, measured in seconds.

### health-check.timeout

Health check timeout, measured in milliseconds.

### health-check.lazy

Lazy state, defaults to `true`, no testing is performed when this provider node is not in use.

### health-check.expected-status

Refer to [expected status](../proxy-groups/index.md#expected-status).

## Override

Override node content, the following fields are supported.

### override.additional-prefix

Add a fixed prefix to the node name.

### override.additional-suffix

Add a fixed suffix to the node name.

### override.proxy-name

Replace the content of the node name, supporting regular expressions, where pattern is the replacement content and target is the replacement target.

### Configuration Items

## Filter

Filter nodes that meet keywords or [regular expressions](https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex/blob/master/translations/README-cn.md), multiple regular expressions can be separated by `.

## Exclude Filter

Exclude nodes that meet keywords or [regular expressions](https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex/blob/master/translations/README-cn.md), multiple regular expressions can be separated by `.

## Exclude Type

Regular expressions are not supported; use `|` to separate and exclude based on node type.
