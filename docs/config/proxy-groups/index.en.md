## name

Required, the name of the proxy group.

!!! note
    If there are special characters, they should be enclosed in quotes.

## type

Required, the type of the proxy group.

## proxies

References to [outbound proxies](../proxies/index.md) or other proxy groups.

## use

References to [proxy sets](../proxy-providers/index.md).

## url

Health check test address.

!!! note 
    It will only check the proxies field of the proxy group, and will not check the proxies of the proxy providers introduced through use.

## interval

Health check interval; if not 0, periodic testing is enabled, measured in seconds.

## lazy

Lazy state, defaults to `true`. If the current proxy group is not selected, no testing is performed.

## timeout

Health check timeout, measured in milliseconds.

## max-failed-times

Maximum number of failures; exceeding this triggers a forced health check, default is 5.

## disable-udp

Disables `UDP` for this proxy group.

## interface-name

!!! warning
    The interface-name in the proxy group will soon be deprecated, please use the [interface-name](../proxies/index.md#interface-name) in the proxy node.

Specifies the [outbound interface](../general.md#outbound-interface) for the proxy group.

!!! info ""
    Priority: Proxy Node > Proxy Policy > Global.

## routing-mark


!!! warning
    The routing-mark in the proxy group will soon be deprecated, please use the [routing-mark](../proxies/index.md#routing-mark) in the proxy node.

The [routing mark](../general.md#routing-mark) attached when the proxy group is outbound.

!!! info ""
    Priority: Proxy Node > Proxy Policy > Global.

## include-all

Includes all [outbound proxies](../proxies/index.md) and [proxy sets](../proxy-providers/index.md), sorted by name.

!!! info ""
    Inclusion does not include proxy groups; other proxy groups can be included in [proxies](./index.md#proxies).

## include-all-proxies

Includes all [outbound proxies](../proxies/index.md), sorted by name.

!!! info ""
    Inclusion does not include proxy groups; other proxy groups can be included in [`proxies`](./index.md#proxies).

## include-all-providers

Includes all [proxy sets](../proxy-providers/index.md), sorted by name.

!!! info ""
    This will invalidate [including proxy sets](./index.md#use).

## filter

Filters nodes that meet keywords or [regular expressions](https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex/blob/master/translations/README-cn.md). You can use ` to separate multiple regular expressions.

!!! info ""
    This only applies to included proxy sets and [including all outbound proxies](./index.md#include-all-proxies).

## exclude-filter

Excludes nodes that meet keywords or [regular expressions](https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex/blob/master/translations/README-cn.md). You can use ` to separate multiple regular expressions.

## exclude-type

Regular expressions are not supported. Split by `|`, exclude based on node type, only excluding [ingress outbound proxies](#proxies)

For supported types, please refer to [Adapter Type](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo/blob/fbead56ec97ae93f904f4476df1741af718c9c2a/constant/adapters.go#L18-L45), ignore case sensitivity

## expected-status

The expected HTTP response status code during health checks. If this field is configured, a node is considered available only when the response status code matches the expected status. The default is `*`, indicating no requirements on the response status.

### syntax

You can use `/` to match multiple status codes, `-` to match a range of statuses, and mix them.

#### example

Match status codes 200 and 302.

```{.yaml linenums="1"}
expected-status: 200/302
```

Match status codes from 400 to 503.

```{.yaml linenums="1"}
expected-status: 400-503
```

Match status codes 200 and 302, as well as from 400 to 503.

```{.yaml linenums="1"}
expected-status: 200/302/400-503
```

## hidden

Returns `hidden` status in the API to hide the display of this proxy group (requires front-end adaptation using the API).

## icon

Returns the string input for `icon` in the API to display in this proxy group (requires front-end adaptation using the API).
